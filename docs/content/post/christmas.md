More than 500 gizmos and gadgets, 285 children and around 15 Christmas jumpers will feature in tonight's Toy Show.

Ryan Tubridy will tonight host the eagerly-awaited show, which is this year inspired by Beauty And The Beast.

The presenter believes that it's all about its young stars.

"I saw the rehearsal today and I was moved to tears with this brother and sister act that do something tomorrow," he said. "I think tomorrow night is going to be about kids more than ever before."

The enthusiastic host said the week of rehearsals leading to tonight could take their toll, but added that he "forgets everything" once the show begins.

"When the cameras are rolling on any Toy Show, I forget the cameras are rolling. I stomp around that studio," he said. "For this week, my life becomes very peculiar, particularly bizarre, but actually quite lovely."

Ryan also said he recently met the grandparents of John Joe Brennan, the young horologist who appeared on the Toy Show a number of years ago, who is now 14.

"He's still all about the clocks. Nothing has changed," he said. "It was a joy, so I keep an eye on him."

Emma Murray (11) from Meath will be treating viewers to some country and western singing. The Dolly Parton fan told the Herald there was nothing like walking onto the famed set for the first time.

"It felt like you were in a fairytale. It was lovely," she said. "When the Toy Show starts, it is literally Christmas."
