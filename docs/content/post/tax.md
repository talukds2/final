It is now probable that major reform of the US tax system will be enacted before the end of 2017. Nearly 1,000 pages of tax legislation are now being considered and working their way through the US legislative process at an almost unprecedented pace.
These are significant proposals, which will undoubtedly have a wide-ranging impact on all US business and individuals.
What is also becoming clear is that US tax reform as proposed has a global reach with knock-on implications for US companies operating in Ireland and Irish companies doing business in the US.

The last overhaul of the US tax system was more than 30 years ago and since then there have been multiple failed attempts to pass meaningful reform. This lack of progress has led to a common view of the US tax system being uncompetitive and a roadblock for driving economic growth.
It was against this background that it became a cornerstone issue during the presidential election with the now President Trump stating reform was one of his key policy objectives when elected.

It now appears that tax reform will be his first major legislative victory since taking office.
After a marathon effort, it now appears a final sprint to legislative approval is taking place with both the House and Senate passing legislation in the last couple of weeks.

The legislative process is now at reconciliation stage where both the House of Representatives and the Senate will be required to appoint members to a conference committee which will work to reconcile the differences between both versions of legislation and present a final bill. Unless unexpected issues arise, we expect both the House and Senate to vote on a final bill over the coming week.
What does all this mean for Irish business? While the exact details have not yet been agreed, the House and the Senate appear to be aligned on some of the core policy cornerstones of tax reform.

The headline change is the likely significant reduction of the US corporate tax rate from the current rate of 35pc to a rate of 20pc (although a lever of a small percentage change to this could be used to fund other tax cuts proposed at reconciliation stage).

While this is a significant reduction, the difference between it and the Irish 12.5pc rate (particularly when you factor in US State taxes), is likely to mean that Ireland will remain competitive, while Irish companies operating in the US will likely welcome the potential reduction in tax burden.

Other proposals, most of which are classified as US 'revenue-raisers', are likely to have a more significant impact from an Irish tax perspective.
The proposed legislation includes provisions which move the US towards a form of 'territorial' system which would permit overseas subsidiaries to repatriate their profits to the US without paying additional US tax. To facilitate this, US firms will be subject to a one-time tax on their untaxed overseas earnings. Given that this tax applies whether or not the funds are repatriated it is likely that a significant amount of this cash will end up back to the US.

There are also a number of complex provisions that seek to ensure that certain profits of overseas subsidiaries are taxed at a minimum rate in the US. At the same time there are provisions which are aimed at encouraging the movement of intangible assets to the US, the so called 'carrot and stick' approach to encouraging companies to hold their intellectual property in the US.
The future location of investments by US groups may be influenced by this.

Other proposals to widen the US corporate tax base include restricting the tax deductibility of payments made by US companies to related overseas subsidiaries, and restrictive interest limitation proposals.
While these provisions would likely be effective from January 1, 2018, it now appears that the reduced corporate tax rate of 20pc may not be effective until January 1, 2019. This alone could cause a significant spike in the amount of tax that US companies pay next year.

While there is clearly much to be considered, Irish business must quickly move to review and reflect on how these changes will affect them, particularly given many of the changes will likely be effective in a matter of weeks.

All eyes from the business community will be on Washington this week to see whether this once-in-a-generation reform will get over the finish line.
