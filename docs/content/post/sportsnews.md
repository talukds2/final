Munster coach Johann van Graan played down accusations from Leicester counterpart Matt O'Connor that his side were cynical at the breakdown during his side's comprehensive 33-10 Champions Cup win at Thomond Park.
A scintillating opening half-hour laid the basis for the win, tries from Rhys Marshall and Simon Zebo, aided by four successful Ian Keatley kicks, helping Munster build a 20-0 lead which rarely looked like being threatened.

They did lose Andrew Conway to a sickening second-half concussion following a collision but, on a bitterly cold evening, second-half tries from Peter O'Mahony and Chris Cloete completed the full set.

Yet it was the post match comments of Leicester coach O'Connor that provided a talking point, with Van Graan quick to offer this repost:
“The breakdown was a big focus for us, we adapted to the referee quite well, our physicality was very good there," said the new Munster coach.

“Whoever adapts better to the referee performs better, there were 50-50 decisions. The referee handled the game very well.
"We started the game pretty well, we're happy with the win and the bonus point. There a lot of things we can do well but we have areas we can improve. On Monday we will start again from zero.

“But I enjoyed the day and the people from Munster and I most enjoyed the way we defended the line late on.”
Munster were superb in every facet of play; Leicester were ragged and rudderless from the off.

With a handful of debutants tasting European action for the first time, a relatively untested midfield passing the test with flying colours, this was a wonderful night for Johann van Graan, the Munster coach also making his European bow.
Unlike last season, Munster will be conscious of not allowing the Tigers to earn revenge next week; they don't look half as well equipped to do so and were so poor here. Munster are now in control of their European destiny as they seek to at least emulate last season's semi-final appearance.

Once regarded as European heavyweights, the yawning gap between Munster's 2008 success, the fourth shared equally between the sides in a seven year period at the start of the century, had reduced them to the ranks of middleweights since.
Munster have been more than capable of landing a punch or three since then without convincing they have enough to deliver a knock-out blow.

Victory here, especially after Racing 92 dropped crucial points in Castres just a half-hour before when failing to land an equalising penalty goal, would be crucial to this season's ambitions.

Despite the unseemly late kick-off, the throaty hordes packed the famous ground though some empty seats perhaps owed more to the inclement driving conditions than a lack of willing support.
Those who did were rewarded with a stunning opening from both sides; Munster put Leicester into bat by winning the toss and allowing the visitors to kick of into the wind and they eagerly ran everything.
Munster joined in too, with Rory Scannell effecting a delicious pass as the game opened at a terrific pace.

They took the lead in the eighth minute thanks to Andrew Conway's surging run, collecting Telusa Veainu's poor kick ahead, the winger setting off on a mazy run from inside his own half until being scragged by George Ford.

Munster made territorial hay and, though they got within two metres of the try-line thanks to surges from CJ Stander, Dave Kilcoyne and Billy Holland, they had to make do with an Ian Keatley penalty.
