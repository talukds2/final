Nearly 200,000 residents have been evacuated from their homes in California as firefighters battle several raging wildfires.
Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in San Diego on Thursday after a new blaze spread from 10 acres to 4,100 acres in just a few hours.
Three firefighters have been injured and about 500 buildings destroyed.
One death has been reported - a woman's body was found in a burned-out area in Ventura County.
But an official told the Ventura Country Star newspaper that the death, in the town of Ojai, may have been the result of a car crash not related to the fire.

On Friday, US President Donald Trump issued a state of emergency in California, which will free up funding to "help alleviate the hardship and suffering that the emergency may inflict on the local population".
About 5,700 firefighters have been battling the brushfires, officials have said, with firefighters drafted in from neighbouring states to help.

In the wealthy Los Angeles enclave of Bel Air, firefighters were seen removing artwork from luxury homes on Wednesday as the Skirball Fire raged.
The neighbourhood is home to celebrities and business leaders from Beyonce to Elon Musk.
Singer Lionel Richie cancelled a Las Vegas performance for Wednesday evening, saying he was "helping family evacuate to a safer place".
An estate and vineyard owned by Rupert Murdoch also suffered some damage.
The media mogul said in a statement: "We believe the winery and house are still intact."
The Los Angeles Times said Mr Murdoch paid nearly $30m (Â£22m) for the property four years ago.
