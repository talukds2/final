      <description>It could take the Army up to two hours to deploy specialist soldiers to Dublin in the event of a terrorist attack. The Sunday Times reports that the Army Ranger Wing, based in the Curragh in Kildare, does not have 24-hour access to helicopters. Those that are available can only transport a small number of fully equipped soldiers at a time. Garda√≠ and Defence Forces took part in a training exercise in the capital during the week, but response times for the rest of the country have not yet been tested.</description>
