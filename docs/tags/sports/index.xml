      <description>Munster coach Johann van Graan played down accusations from Leicester counterpart Matt O&amp;rsquo;Connor that his side were cynical at the breakdown during his side&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive 33-10 Champions Cup win at Thomond Park. A scintillating opening half-hour laid the basis for the win, tries from Rhys Marshall and Simon Zebo, aided by four successful Ian Keatley kicks, helping Munster build a 20-0 lead which rarely looked like being threatened.
