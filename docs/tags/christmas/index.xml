      <description>More than 500 gizmos and gadgets, 285 children and around 15 Christmas jumpers will feature in tonight&amp;rsquo;s Toy Show.
Ryan Tubridy will tonight host the eagerly-awaited show, which is this year inspired by Beauty And The Beast.
The presenter believes that it&amp;rsquo;s all about its young stars.
&amp;ldquo;I saw the rehearsal today and I was moved to tears with this brother and sister act that do something tomorrow,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;I think tomorrow night is going to be about kids more than ever before.</description>
