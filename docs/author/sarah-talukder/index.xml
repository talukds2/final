      <description>Theresa May’s hopes of securing a unique post-Brexit trade deal with the EU were under threat on Saturday night as Brussels said it was coming under international pressure to deny Britain special treatment.
After a week that saw May reach a deal with the EU that will allow Brexit talks to move forward on to future trade relations, EU officials insisted a bespoke deal more favourable to the UK than other non-EU nations was out of the question.</description>

      <description>Nearly 200,000 residents have been evacuated from their homes in California as firefighters battle several raging wildfires. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in San Diego on Thursday after a new blaze spread from 10 acres to 4,100 acres in just a few hours. Three firefighters have been injured and about 500 buildings destroyed. One death has been reported - a woman&amp;rsquo;s body was found in a burned-out area in Ventura County.</description>

      <title>Fallout from Trump&#39;s US tax reforms is a reality Irish business must grasp</title>

      <description>It is now probable that major reform of the US tax system will be enacted before the end of 2017. Nearly 1,000 pages of tax legislation are now being considered and working their way through the US legislative process at an almost unprecedented pace. These are significant proposals, which will undoubtedly have a wide-ranging impact on all US business and individuals. What is also becoming clear is that US tax reform as proposed has a global reach with knock-on implications for US companies operating in Ireland and Irish companies doing business in the US.</description>

      <description>It could take the Army up to two hours to deploy specialist soldiers to Dublin in the event of a terrorist attack. The Sunday Times reports that the Army Ranger Wing, based in the Curragh in Kildare, does not have 24-hour access to helicopters. Those that are available can only transport a small number of fully equipped soldiers at a time. Gardaí and Defence Forces took part in a training exercise in the capital during the week, but response times for the rest of the country have not yet been tested.</description>
