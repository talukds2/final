      <description>More than 500 gizmos and gadgets, 285 children and around 15 Christmas jumpers will feature in tonight&amp;rsquo;s Toy Show.
Ryan Tubridy will tonight host the eagerly-awaited show, which is this year inspired by Beauty And The Beast.
The presenter believes that it&amp;rsquo;s all about its young stars.
&amp;ldquo;I saw the rehearsal today and I was moved to tears with this brother and sister act that do something tomorrow,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;I think tomorrow night is going to be about kids more than ever before.</description>

      <description>Munster coach Johann van Graan played down accusations from Leicester counterpart Matt O&amp;rsquo;Connor that his side were cynical at the breakdown during his side&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive 33-10 Champions Cup win at Thomond Park. A scintillating opening half-hour laid the basis for the win, tries from Rhys Marshall and Simon Zebo, aided by four successful Ian Keatley kicks, helping Munster build a 20-0 lead which rarely looked like being threatened.
